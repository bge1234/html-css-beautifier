CSS beautifer todo:
- Handle nested blocks (like SASS). Use indent argument to space them within printBlock().

The HTML beautifier does the following things:
- Correct indentation.
- Remove empty lines.
- Change all quotes to single or double as defined by user (but not both).
- Change IDs and classes to a single user-defined case.

The CSS beautifier corrects the spacing around the blocks and around the colons and semicolons.
