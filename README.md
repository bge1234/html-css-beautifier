CSS todo:
- Refactor by pulling out logic into separate functions and passing in next token/set of tokens.
- Handle nested blocks (like SASS)

The HTML beautifier does the following things:
- Correct indentation.
- Remove empty lines.
- Change all quotes to single or double as defined by user (but not both).
- Change IDs and classes to a single user-defined case.

The CSS beautifier corrects the spacing around the blocks and around the colons and semicolons.
