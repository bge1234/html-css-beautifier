The HTML linter will lint for the following things:
- Proper indentation.
- Extra empty lines.
- Use of either single or double quotes throughout (but not both).
- Consistent use of case on id and class names.

The CSS linter will lint for correct spacing around the blocks and around the colons and semicolons.

CSS todo:
- Ignore comments.
- Handle multiple padding and margin properties in one block.
- Refactor by pulling out logic into separate funtions and passing in next token/set of tokens.
