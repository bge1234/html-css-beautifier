CSS todo:
- Get it working for multiple levels of nested blocks.
- Switch all cases to be consistent (user-defined).
- Output to separate file instead of console.logging everything.
- Take command line arguments.

The HTML beautifier does the following things:
- Correct indentation.
- Remove empty lines.
- Change all quotes to single or double as defined by user (but not both).
- Change IDs and classes to a single user-defined case.

The CSS beautifier corrects the spacing around the blocks and around the colons and semicolons.
