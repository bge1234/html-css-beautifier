CSS todo:
- Margin and padding properties with only one value don't work right.
- Put blank lines between blocks that are not nested.
- Check that all cases of IDs and classes are consistent.
- Output to separate file instead of console.logging everything.
- Take command line arguments.

The HTML beautifier does the following things:
- Correct indentation.
- Remove empty lines.
- Change all quotes to single or double as defined by user (but not both).
- Change IDs and classes to a single user-defined case.

The CSS beautifier corrects the spacing around the blocks and around the colons and semicolons.

Joint todo:
- Replace cases across all HTML and CSS files.
- Find dead CSS.
